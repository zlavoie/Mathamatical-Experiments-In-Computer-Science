Experiments in Computer Science
      Computers provide us with tools to explore mathematics in deeper ways than ever before. 
      They allow empirical testing of mathematical conjectures with elusive proofs. 
      Computers enable us to experimentally analyze algorithms whose performance defies theoretical analysis. 
      This project focuses on the delicate balance between theory and practice in computer science, revealing the dual and sometimes contradictory nature of computer science as both an engineering and a mathematical discipline.
